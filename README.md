# 811372A-3007 Software Development, Maintenance and Operations 2025 Project 1 - Eemil Kulmala

This repository contains an implementation of project 1 on the course SDMO 2025.

## Contents

- `project1devs/`: Directory with all data files of the project
- `project1developers.py`: Course provided script demonstrating mining developer information and Bird heuristic to determine duplicate developers
- `alternative_method.py`: An enhanced version of the Bird heuristic, implemented as a part of the project
- `test/`: Directory with all unit tests for the implementation
- `requirements.txt`: List of used libraries with specified versions
- `.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml`: Automated workflow for SonarCloud
- `tox.ini`: An initialization file for Tox coverage extraction


## Running the scripts

The versions of imported libraries are provided in `requirements.txt`.

It is recommended to create a Python virtual environment and install the exact versions there.

For running the alternative_method.py algorithm, a devs.csv-file containing name, email -pairs must be located at project1devs/. This file can be generated by using the script project1developers.py.

The implementation has been tested and run in Linux Ubuntu 24.04, and tests were run using pytest. This repository also contains an automated workflow for SonarCloud, which runs at every push on the repository. The workflow also runs tox.ini to run the tests and extract coverage metrics.
